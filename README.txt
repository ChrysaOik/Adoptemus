We created an implementation of an adoption site for the course "Web Engineering" at the Public 
University of Navarra.

For the frontend we used HTML, CSS and Javascript and we also focused a lot on the accesibility
of the website by adding ARIA TAGS and an accessibility button that changes the contrast of the web
and the font.

For the backend we used php and we implemented the MVC pattern.
